// The download folder, and the shared popup that shows it.
//
// This is a singleton because a bar widget is instantiated once per monitor.
// Keeping the model and popup here gives every monitor a view onto the
// same state, and prevents IPC from opening a separate popup per monitor.
//
// A normal download folder is read by FolderListModel: no shell, no quoting,
// and no path from a filename into an exec. A folder too large to read that
// way goes through bin/downloads instead, which is the only reason a helper
// exists here at all. It is handed an argument array rather than a command
// string, so nothing is ever split by a shell, and it refuses any path that
// is not an absolute directory.
//
// Either way the filenames are chosen by whoever made the file, so every Text
// is PlainText - on the default AutoText, Qt decides for itself that a name
// looks like markup and renders it as rich text, and rich text really does
// fetch `<img src="http://...">`.
//
// Glyphs are \u escapes rather than literal characters, so the source
// survives editors and patches that mangle private-use codepoints.

  // the shell 7 seconds of CPU - one full re-read per file - and a shell that
  // never restarts cannot afford that.
  //
  // So the watcher is something the folder has to earn. Under maxScan it
  // stays live and a download shows up the moment it lands. Past that the
  // model is detached after each scan and the folder is polled instead, which
